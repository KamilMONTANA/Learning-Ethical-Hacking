I'm starting my journey with learning ARP Spoofing. I've set up an environment that includes pfSense as a router/firewall and connected both a Kali Linux machine and a Metasploitable2 machine to it. Next, I scanned the network using sudo netdiscover to find the devices connected to the network. I allowed the Kali Linux machine, as root, to forward packets on behalf of other computers using the command "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward". Later, I generated fake responses using "arpspoof -i eth0 -t <victim_ip> <router_ip>" and "arpspoof -i eth0 -t <router_ip> <victim_ip>". I started monitoring with "urlsnarf -i eth0". Then, I moved to the Metasploitable machine and used the command "wget http://www.google.com". After a while, I noticed that I had successfully captured a packet on the Kali Linux machine. As I continued learning, I created very simple programs. The first one detects ARP spoofing attacks (arpDetector.py), the second one launches attacks (arpSpoof.py), and the third one (macFlooding.py) aims to overload the CAM memory in the router and switch. All the programs were quite challenging for me, although they are simple in structure and definitely not advanced hacking tools. :)
